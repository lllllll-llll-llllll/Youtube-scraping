REGEX
"videoId":"(.*?)"

NOTES
for a single regex match, this is the most recent video
for an array of global matches, up to 30 ids are found, each value is the id for a video. array[0] being the most recent video

when you scrape the channel's video page, by default it seems videos are listed newest first
this means the first video id to be matched with this regex is the newest video
could be useful for checking whether a channel has any new videos posted
